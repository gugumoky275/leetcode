Simple add 2 numbers in list form, luckily digits are stored in reverse order, else
lists should have been reversed or a smart maybe recursive solution should be approached.

C++ Recursive has better time than iterative even with the stack overhead.

Also solved recursive in Python and added an inversion list function.
